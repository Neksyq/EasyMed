# Prescription Fulfillment & Delivery System


This project is a **Prescription Fulfillment & Delivery System** that allows doctors to create digital prescriptions, pharmacies to manage and fulfill those prescriptions, and couriers to handle and track medication delivery. The system emphasizes **security**, **API integration**, and **compliance with healthcare standards** such as **HL7** and **FHIR**, ensuring adherence to **HIPAA**, **GDPR**, and other healthcare regulations.
